# Mad Scientist
This was a group project for COSC2036 - Games Design at Algoma University,
Myself and two team members wrote a game design document then an implementation
of our proposed game over the course of one semester. This game takes heavy
inspiration from "Evil Genius". In it, you take the role of a Mad Scientist who issues orders to minions to rob the local towns, and pillage the local graveyard, in order to buy equipment and find "parts" to build an ultimate creation, that will then be released upon the world.

# TODO

Some of the content of this game is under a questionable license, it should all
be attributed but there's definitely some video game sprites in there. 
I *think* they are useable under Canadian Fair-Dealing laws since this 
was a research/private study project, but please don't re-use them from here, 
and if some lawyer wants them gone, please just email me.

This project is abandonware, It was a fun group project, I learned some Java
and the Slick Game Engine, but it has lots of bugs and is very simplistic. I'm
putting it up here so I can refer to it and share it with my friends.
