MINION:
These little guys do your dirty work, which explains their awful smell

These are your faithful minions, they're small, funny looking, and they smell like
rotting meat, but they're good little workers, and because they're repulsive and a
little stupid, they'll work for cheap and do things normal people wouldn't.  They'll
even rob graves for you because they get a free meal out of it.


MONSTER:
Little more than walking corpses, they're good for throwing bodies at attackers.

Stitched together from body parts and brought to life with love and 10,000 volts, 
these monsters make up your defenses against those foolish villagers who just can't 
understand how important the work you are doing is.  The only downfall is that they
smell even worse than your servants, but they don't feel pain so they don't run away.


LAB EQUIPMENT:
Beakers, tools, instruments, and a Tesla coil (which explains your hairdo)


BED:
It's just a lice-infested burlap sack stuffed with straw, but it beats the floor

Not wanting to take the time and spend the money on proper beds, we just had a servant
steal some old potato sacks and stuff them with straw.  Yes, they are rather scratchy,
but if you get lucky you can find a bedbug in one big enough for a midnight snack.


LIBRARY:
Full of books on the sciences, art, the arcane, and more, and even some pretty pictures.

This is your pride and joy, your collection of books and articles that you have built
up over your academic career, some of which you have even written.  It is your
compendium of everything you know, lovingly preserved against time.  The books on
anatomy are kept on the top shelf out of reach of easily distracted servants.
