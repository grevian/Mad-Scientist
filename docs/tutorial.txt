TUTORIAL:
The little green guys running around aimlessly are your servants.  They work
for little more than a meal and a bed, but they're not the brightest.  You
should give them a job to do.  Click the Map button, click the town, and click
"+" next to the hunchback icon twice to send two hunchbacks into town to rob and
extort the locals.

Now, click the graveyard, and send a hunchback there to rob graves and collect
body parts.  Hit Esc to return to the main game screen.

[display when body parts == 6 && gold ==500]
Now, you have enough gold and body parts to build your first monster.
Click the Acme icon to enter the Store screen, and click to build a
Monster.  You will need at least one available hunchback to help build
it.

You can also hire more minions, buy upgrades and stuff from this screen.
You will need to perform research and upgrade your lab equipment to 
build your Masterpiece.
